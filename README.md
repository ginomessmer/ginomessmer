I am a consultant and software developer with 10 years of experience and over 5 years of professional experience. I am profound in building full-stack projects in C#, .NET, Microsoft Azure while keeping costs, best-practices, and good software design in mind.

In my spare time, I love traveling, developing applications, and writing blog posts. Mostly, I roam around in the realms of **.NET, Azure, Angular, React, IaC, DevOps**, and much more. I want to make an impact with what I'm doing. I love connecting with peers. I'm always eager to discover new technologies and I love sharing my knowledge with others on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ginomessmer) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/ginomessmer).
